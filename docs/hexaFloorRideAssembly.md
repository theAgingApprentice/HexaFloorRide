# HexaFloorRide Assembly Instructions

This document takes you through the steps neccessary to successfully assemble version 3 of the HexaFloorRide robot.

## What you need

Before you start make sure that you have all [the hardware that you need](/docs/hexaFloorRideHardware.md).

## Step 1 - Servo motor mounting preparations

Each HS-485HB servo motor come with four rubber grommets and four brass pins that need to be inserted into the motor's four mounting brackets. Note that the rubber grommets are asymmetrical. Be certain to insert them with the round part facing in toward the servo body. If you insert the grommets backwards then they will be hard to push in, the brass pins will not go in as easily, and the screws will not line up with the mounting holes on the chassis. When they are installed in the correct orientation the assembly goes easily.
## Step 2 - Assemble three right legs

Repeat the steps in this section three times in order to create the three right legs that we need. Make note of the orientation of the motors relative to the components that make up the leg in figure 1. Remember that the horns and shoes face toward the front of the robot.

          <li>Screw the hip onto the first motor's horn.</li>  
          <li>Screw the second motor into the hip motor bracket.</li>  
          <li>Set the second motor to 90 degrees.</li>  
          <li>Screw one end of the upper leg to the horn of the second motor.</li>  
          <li>Set the third motor to 90 degrees.</li>  
          <li>Screw the third motor onto the other end of the upper leg.</li>  
          <li>Screw the lower leg onto the third motor via its motor bracket.</li> 
       </ol>

## Step 3 - Assemble three left legs

Repeat the steps in this section three times in order to create the three left legs that we need. Make note of the orientation of the motors relative to the components that make up the leg in figure 2. Remember that the horns and shoes face toward the front of the robot.

          <li>Screw the hip onto the first motor's horn.</li>  
          <li>Screw the second motor into the hip motor bracket.</li>  
          <li>Set the second motor to 90 degrees.</li>  
          <li>Screw one end of the upper leg to the horn of the second motor.</li>  
          <li>Set the third motor to 90 degrees.</li>  
          <li>Screw the third motor onto the other end of the upper leg.</li>  
          <li>Screw the lower leg onto the third motor via its motor bracket.</li> 
       </ol>  
    </td>
  </tr>  
</table> 

## Step 4 - Connect legs to the lower body

Repeat the steps in this section six times in order to attach all six legs to the robot. Make note of the orientation of the motors in figure 3. It is important to ensure that the three motors on each side of the robot body are oriented the same way. When you are done the direction that the servo horns are facing will be considered the front of the robot.

          <li>Use four screws and nuts to secure the assembly in place.</li>  
       </ol> 
       You have now completed assembly of the lower body and legs. Next you need to assemble the electronics platform.

## Step 5 - Mount the upper body and electronics

```We are still in the design phase for HexaFloorRide's electronics. At present the thinking is that they will connect to the mounting post.```

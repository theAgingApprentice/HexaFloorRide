# PCB

This page has details about the PCB used for the Hexbot robot. At present we are using a breadboard because we have not designed or manufactured the PCB. Here are the details regarding the breadboard.  

## Design

The circuitry for the Hexbot robot is designed in Eagle CAD.

## Fabrication

The PCB is fabricated using a third party service.

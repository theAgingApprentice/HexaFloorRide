### Motors
The three leg joint motors are [MG996R Servo motors](https://components101.com/motors/mg996r-servo-motor-datasheet). Each of the three motors require a [Mallofusa 25 tooth Servo Horn](https://www.amazon.ca/Mallofusa-Servo-Aluminum-Silvery-Helicopter/dp/B00NOGMK3M)s, 18 [M3 0.5 x 10 cap head screws](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07FDLN8C3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), 16 [M3 nuts](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07FDLN8C3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and 2 M3 0.5 x6 button head screws (that come with the horns). The servo motors are driven by a pair of [SunFounder PCA9685 16 Channel 12 Bit PWM Servo Drivers](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B014KTSMLA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

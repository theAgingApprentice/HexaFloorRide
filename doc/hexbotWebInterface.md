# Hexbot Web Interface

Hexbot features a 2.4GHz 802.11n WiFi radio that requires a WiFi access point capable of communicating at 150Mbps. Hexbot hosts a webserver that can be used to configure values stored in non volitile memory (NVRAM) as well as perform over-the-air (OTA) firmware uppdates.

## Configuring NVRam

Certain configuration values stored in NVRAM, such as the MQTT boker IP address, can be set via the web interface. Full details can be found [here](hexbotConfigNVRAM.md).

## OTA Firmware Updates

The firmware for Hexbot can be updated via the web interface. See full details [here](webOTA.md).
